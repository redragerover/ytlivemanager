# ytlivemanager

in this example you can record a youtube livestream using cli tool Streamlink available here https://streamlink.github.io/install.html

I will probably make this even more modular and able to handle multiples channels.

to get starter simply `npm install && npm start`
You will probably need Node 18


I want to make this into a simple package and worker you just run and give it 3 functions to handle live stream state for a channel and y'all can do what you want with it
